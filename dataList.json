I was not in our village when the director came to our house to give my letter, so he had handed it to my parents. I was suprised when I returned home to see my Mum and Dad greated me with a big smile in their face. `What's going here?`, asked me. They then replied me: 'We've got good news for you'. 'Good news for me?', said me rather unexcpecting to laugh. My mum showed the letter and handed it out to me. I read, I read, I read and what it said was something that I have never came up with. Anyway, this was not a bad thing but a great opportunity for me myself so I decided to go to make this thing happen. An organisation Onja convoked me to study for two years, and learn to coding and English. There was no doubt, I was happy and ready to do that. This NGO is an organisation that support student who are intelligent but from a poor family and do not have the opportunity to continue their study anymore. ",
